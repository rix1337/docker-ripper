# docker-ripper

[![Github Sponsorship](https://img.shields.io/badge/support-me-red.svg)](https://github.com/users/rix1337/sponsorship)

This container will detect optical disks by their type and rip them automatically.

# Output

Disc Type | Output | Tools used
---|---|---
CD | MP3 and FLAC | abcde (lame and flac)
Data-Disk | Uncompressed .ISO | ddrescue
DVD | MKV | MakeMKV
BluRay | MKV | MakeMKV

### Prerequistites

#### (1) Create the required directories, for example, in /home/yourusername. Do _not_ use sudo mkdir to achieve this.

```
mkdir config rips
```

#### (2) Find out the name(s) of the optical drive

```
lsscsi -g
```

In this example, /dev/sr0 and /dev/sg0 are the two files that refer to a single optical drive. These names will be
needed for the docker run command.

![docker run](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rix1337/docker-ripper/master/.github/screenshots/dockerrun.png)

## Docker run

In the command below, the paths refer to the output from your lsscsi-g command, along with your config and rips
directories. If you created /home/yourusername/config and /home/yourusername/rips then those are your paths.

```
docker run -d \
  --name="Ripper" \
  -v /path/to/config/:/config:rw \
  -v /path/to/rips/:/out:rw \
  -p port:9090 \
  --device=/dev/sr0:/dev/sr0 \
  --device=/dev/sg0:/dev/sg0 \
  rix1337/docker-ripper:manual-latest
  ```

Some systems are not able to pass through optical drives without this flag
`--privileged`

#### Configuring the web UI for logs

Add these optional parameters when running the container
````
  -e /ripper-ui=OPTIONAL_WEB_UI_PATH_PREFIX \ 
  -e myusername=OPTIONAL_WEB_UI_USERNAME \ 
  -e strongpassword=OPTIONAL_WEB_UI_PASSWORD \
````

`OPTIONAL_WEB_UI_USERNAME ` and `OPTIONAL_WEB_UI_PASSWORD ` both need to be set to enable http basic auth for the web UI.
`OPTIONAL_WEB_UI_PATH_PREFIX ` can be used to set a path prefix (e.g. `/ripper-ui`). This is useful when you are running multiple services at one domain.

### Please note

**To properly detect optical disk types in a docker environment this script relies on makemkvcon output.**

MakeMKV is free while in Beta, but requires a valid license key. Ripper tries to fetch the latest free beta key on
launch. Without a purchased license key Ripper may stop running at any time.

#### If you have purchased a license key to MakeMKV/Ripper:

1) after starting the container, go into the config directory you created, edit the file
   called `enter-your-key-then-rename-to.settings.conf`, and add your key between the
   quotes `app_Key = "`**[ENTER KEY HERE]**`"` then save and rename the file to settings.conf

![makemkv license](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rix1337/docker-ripper/master/.github/screenshots/makemkvkey.png)

2) Remove the remaining file `enter-your-key-then-rename-to.settings.conf`
   ![sudo rm enter your key](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rix1337/docker-ripper/master/.github/screenshots/sudormenteryourkey.png)

3) At this point your config directory should look like this:  
   ![config directory](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rix1337/docker-ripper/master/.github/screenshots/configdirectory.png)

# Docker compose

Check the device mount points and optional settings before you run the container!

`docker-compose up -d`

# FAQ

### MakeMKV needs an update!

_You will need to use a purchased license key - or have to wait until an updated image is available. Issues regarding this will be closed unanswered._

_You will find the PPA-based build under the `latest`/`ppa-latest` tags on docker hub. These should be the most stable way to run ripper. A manual build of makemkv can be found unter the `manual-latest` and versioned tags. For users without a License key it is recommended to use the `manual-latest` image, as it is updated much faster to newly released makemkv versions - that are required when running with the free beta key._

### Do you offer support?

_Yes, but only for my [sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/rix1337). Not a sponsor - no support. Want to help yourself? Fork this repo and try fixing it yourself. I will happily review your pull request. For more information see [LICENSE.md](https://github.com/rix1337/docker-ripper/blob/master/LICENSE.md)_

### There is an error regarding 'ccextractor'

Add the following line to settings.conf

```
app_ccextractor = "/usr/local/bin/ccextractor" 
```

### How do I set ripper to do something else?

_Ripper will place a bash-file ([ripper.sh](https://github.com/rix1337/docker-ripper/blob/master/root/ripper/ripper.sh))
automatically at /config that is responsible for detecting and ripping disks. You are completely free to modify it on
your local docker host. No modifications to this main image are required for minor edits to that file._

_Additionally, you have the option of creating medium-specific override scripts in that same directory location:_

Medium | Script Name | Purpose
--- | --- | ---
BluRay | `BLURAYrip.sh` | Overrides BluRay ripping commands in `ripper.sh` with script operation
DVD | `DVDrip.sh` | Overrides DVD ripping commands in `ripper.sh` with script operation
Audio CD | `CDrip.sh` | Overrides audio CD ripping commands in `ripper.sh` with script operation
Data-Disk | `DATArip.sh` | Overrides data disk ripping commands in `ripper.sh` with script operation

_Note that these optional scripts must be of the specified name, have executable permissions set, and be in the same
directory as `ripper.sh` to be executed._

### How do I rip from multiple drives simultaneously?

Simple: run multiple containers of this image, passing through each separate drive accordingly.

### How do I customize the audio ripping output?

_You need to edit /config/abcde.conf_

### I want another output format that requires another piece of software!

_You need to fork this image and build it yourself on docker hub. A good starting point is
the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/rix1337/docker-ripper/blob/master/latest/Dockerfile#L29) that includes setup instructions
for the used ripping software. If your solution works better than the current one, I will happily review your pull
request._

### Am I allowed to use this in a commercial setting?

_Yes, see [LICENSE.md](https://github.com/rix1337/docker-ripper/blob/master/LICENSE.md)._

  work is done by MakeMKV (see above).
